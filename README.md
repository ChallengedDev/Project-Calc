In this very first challenge, you are going to build a simple calculator in your favourite language. 

Building a calculator is a brilliant project, especially if you are new to development. It's relatively simple and small in scope yet contains features that will provide an exploration of several key elements of the language you are learning.

## Requirements
- Written in a language of your choosing
- A web-based interface
- Standard `addition`, `subtraction`, `division` and  `multiplication` features


## Bonus Points
- Memory buttons
- History
- Percentage function
- Accepts both keyboard and mouse input

## Submissions
The great thing with web development is there are often many different ways to achieve the same thing. Submit your solution to allow others to benefit from exploring your solution to the challenge. 

To submit your solution: 
1. Firstly, you will want to Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and then create a branch to create your changes within.  This [guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) should help if you need a little guidance with Git and Github. 
2. Inside the submission directory, create a directory with the naming convention of `Your Name - Language Used` and create your calculator within this directory.
3. Commit and push your changes back to your fork and then create a pull request. 

Your submission will then be reviewed and merged. In the mean time be sure to check out the other solutions and follow [Challenged_Dev](https://twitter.com/Challenged_Dev) on twitter for future challenges.
